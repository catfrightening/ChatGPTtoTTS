# ChatGPTtoTTS
Hello!

This python script puts ChatGPT into the cli along with TTS!

For this script to work you will need your own OpenAI API key and you will need to edit the python file. specificly lines 8, 30, 33, and 36
This code was written by ChatGPT itself. Cool isn't it?

Keep in mind this is one of my first python projects so it may not be the best but I hope it works.
